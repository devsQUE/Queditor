Privacy Policy – Queditor App
Last Updated: 29 August 2025

devsQUE (“we”, “our”, “us”) built the Queditor app as a code editor for developers. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our app.

- If you believe a child has provided data, please contact us to remove it.

6. Third-Party Services

- We do not share your data with third parties.

7. Changes to This Privacy Policy
- We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted here with a new “Last Updated” date.
